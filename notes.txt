DAY 1 (30 / 9 / 22) - HELLO WORLD!

Hello World! is what whould've been said in my index.html file today if I weren't on such a roll!
Not only have I taken the initiative to read about what I plan to make (I know, shock horror!), I've taken the time to start my project practically
Today I've set up a basic webpage structure (index.html, style.cc, index.js) (the basic markup for the structure of the site, the properties of each markup element, 
and the logic which dictates higher-order function of some elements respectively) as the basic infrastructure of my project, as well as some basic implementation of 
the WebGL vertex and fragment shaders (the advanced rendering language used by the GPU to render more complex elements for the site). 
I did have some initial difficulties loading the textures for rendering, 
however I quickly discovered my mistake (typos in function names), and upon adjustment my test worked as expected, rendering the texture to the top right of the canvas element.

(See: Unknown.png)

I plan to implement more mathmatical functions required for more complex rendering during my next session, perhaps importing a preexisting matrix library to save time.
Right now I have a renderer, however that wont be much use for me if I cannot implement an instanciation system to add dynamic game elements to my project.

DAY X
